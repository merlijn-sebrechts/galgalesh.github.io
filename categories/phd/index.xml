      <description>Quick tip: did you know you can open Google Drive, Google Calendar and more as a specific user?
Just add ?authuser= and your URL encoded email address behind the address.
For example,
 https://drive.google.com/?authuser=merlijn.sebrechts%40gmail.com opens Google Drive as user merlijn.sebrechts@gmail.com. https://calendar.google.com/?authuser=merlijn.sebrechts%40ugent.be opens Google Calendar as user merlijn.sebrechts@ugent.be.  This works with almost every google website, including gmail.
 Note: you can use an online tool to URL encode your email address.</description>

      <description>UGent address book support in Mozilla Thunderbird Ghent University has an LDAP address book which contains all students and staff. Adding this address book to Thunderbird is non-trivial, though. Follow these steps to add it.
  Install the extensions &amp;ldquo;TbSync&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Provider for Exchange ActiveSync&amp;rdquo;. (Press alt to show the menu and choose Edit &amp;gt; Preferences &amp;gt; Add-ons and Themes)
  Open TBSync settings, click Account actions &amp;gt; Add New Account &amp;gt; Exchange ActiveSync.</description>

      <title>Who owns my research?</title>

      <description>When I submitted my first paper, I realized I had no idea who owned my research! Was I authorized to transfer the rights to a journal or did I need someone else&amp;rsquo;s permission? After some digging, I found the answer and wrote it all up in a neat little document. So here&amp;rsquo;s the dusted off version, in case it&amp;rsquo;s useful to anyone else.
In short Intellectual property (IP) as a PhD student at Ghent University is largely divided into two parts: research results and educational material.</description>

## Dell Ecoloop Pro

I recently bought the Dell ecoloop pro and regretted it immediately. The advertising for it is borderline deceptive, in my opinion.

My previous experience with Dell backpacks is that they look stylish and professional, are very handy, and very durable. I've used my previous Dell backpack for about 6 years, and it's still very useful, although it's starting to look a bit dated.

When looking for a replacement, I landed on the Dell Ecoloop Pro (CP5723) backpack. The marketing materials show a stylish but versatile backpack that continues Dell's great track record in this space.

The reality, however, is far from it. What I received looked like a cheap knock-off version of what the listing showed. While the backpack is functionally the same, the exterior fabric looks a lot cheaper and crumpled up. The stiff, professional, modern look that sold me is nowhere to be found. At first I thought this must have been a mistake, but after checking again, it's clear that this is the ecoloop pro backpack. The material just looks completely different in real life.

After comparing third-party pictures and video's of Dell's backpacks with their marketing materials, I found that this was was an issue with the entire Ecoloop Pro line, but not with Ecoloop Premium!

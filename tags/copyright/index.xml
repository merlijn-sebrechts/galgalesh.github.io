      <description>The question often comes up of how Snaps and Flatpaks influence copyleft, GPL and LGPL licenses. It is a common misconception that these new packaging formats significantly influence license compliance.
Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice.
Distributing your software in a Snap has no effect on GPL copyleft and LGPL compliance.
 It has no effect on copyleft because containers do not trigger copyleft according to the GNU GPL FAQ [see note].</description>

      <description>When I submitted my first paper, I realized I had no idea who owned my research! Was I authorized to transfer the rights to a journal or did I need someone else&amp;rsquo;s permission? After some digging, I found the answer and wrote it all up in a neat little document. So here&amp;rsquo;s the dusted off version, in case it&amp;rsquo;s useful to anyone else.
In short Intellectual property (IP) as a PhD student at Ghent University is largely divided into two parts: research results and educational material.</description>

      <description>The Snap Store and Flathub are two universal app stores for Linux. They are very different from how traditional software distribution works. As is always the case with new software, the question &amp;ldquo;why do we need this?&amp;rdquo; often arises. &amp;ldquo;Including software in distribution repositories has worked for so long, so why do we need to change it?&amp;rdquo;
 Note: for an introduction into Flatpak and Snap, please read The future of Linux desktop application delivery is Flatpak and Snap.</description>

      <description>Snaps and Flatpaks are often compared to each other because they both make it super easy for Linux users to get the latest versions of desktop applications.

While both are systems for distributing Linux apps, snap is also a tool to build Linux Distributions.</description>
